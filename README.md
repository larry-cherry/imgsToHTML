# Images to HTML

## What it does

* This package was created to build html img tags to be used for a website. If you have hundreds of images from an event and just want the html so you can get your images up quickly this simple script will do that for you. 

## How it works

* The script will look for files in whatever director you put it in. Grab files with the extension .png or .jpg. Then it will build the img tags and export a index.html file with the images. 

## I need this to run on a computer without Python3 installed

* If you have python installed on another computer you can run the following code for and executeable

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller imgsToHTML.py
```
* If you do not have python installed feel free to contact me and I can build the executable for you. 

## Want to contribute

* I love working with other developers and I am open to suggestions on how to improve this script.
